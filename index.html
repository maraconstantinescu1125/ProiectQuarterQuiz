<p>I'm going through many older name generators to update their names in various ways. </p>
<p> Some will get neutral names as an addition, like the elf names, god names and evil names, some will get naming convention updates, like the planet names to minimize the amount of gibberish names, and others will get a bigger overhaul, like the species names. Most of these are older name generators with leftover remnants of different techniques I used years ago, but which I feel are definitely of inferior quality. "What on Earth was I thinking?" comes to mind once in a while.
"Fitting names" is something subjective of course, so there will be very few name generators in which any given person will enjoy every single name, but I'm trying to increase the quality without giving up on diversity. I'll keep you updated on some bigger changes, but smaller chances will likely be added in the background.
